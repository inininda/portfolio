    "short": "Passionate full-stack developer with 5 years of web development experience and 3+ years specializing in Web3. I love solving problems through various approaches and am always eager to learn new technologies.",
    "long": "I'm a passionate full-stack developer with 5 years of experience across 3 companies, specializing in Web3 technologies for the past 3+ years. My journey began as a web developer handling diverse clients and building 10+ websites from scratch using HTML, PHP, and CodeIgniter.\n\nMy Web3 journey started at a sister company where I worked on a Play-to-Earn game concept, handling backend logic for NFT character gameplay and reward systems. This experience introduced me to blockchain gaming and tokenomics.\n\nI then transitioned to my current company, shifting from PHP to JavaScript-based technologies (Vue.js and Node.js). Starting as a frontend developer, I quickly expanded my skills to smart contract development, assisting in NFT collection creation. After proving my capabilities, my boss entrusted me with building NFT and token smart contracts from scratch.\n\nNow working full-stack for 2+ years, I've earned recognition as the 'master of optimization' for my code efficiency improvements. Currently, I'm working on an AI chat platform where users interact with AI-generated imagination characters, handling both frontend and backend development.\n\nI have extensive experience with modern tech stacks including React.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, and Three.js for frontend; Nest.js, Node.js, and PHP for backend; and comprehensive blockchain development using Solidity, Viem, Ethers.js, and cross-chain solutions with LayerZero. I'm proficient in both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems, with expertise in smart contract development, testing with Jest and Mocha, and database management with MySQL and Supabase. I'm driven by optimization challenges and creating efficient, scalable solutions across traditional web, blockchain, and AI applications.",
